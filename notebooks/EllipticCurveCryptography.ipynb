    "### Problems with RSA\n",
    " - RSA is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers\n",
    " - Quantum computers can factor large integers in polynomial time\n",
    " - Quantum computers can break RSA\n",
    " - Quantum computers can't break ECC\n",
    "  - factorization is the trapdoor function for RSA, but it has never been proven that factorization is hard.\n",

    "### Elliptic Curve\n",
    "Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a finite field $F_p$ where $p$ is a prime number. The set of points on $E$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$E(F_p) = \\{(x,y) \\in F_p \\times F_p | y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\} \\cup \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}$$\n",
    "where $a,b \\in F_p$ and $4a^3 + 27b^2 \\neq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ....what?\n",
    "#### Explain Like I'm Five\n",
    " - $E$ is a curve defined over a finite field $F_p$ where $p$ is a prime number\n",
    " - $E$ is the set of points $(x,y)$ that satisfy the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$\n",
    " - $a$ and $b$ are constants that define the curve\n",
    " - $4a^3 + 27b^2 \\neq 0$ is a condition that ensures the curve is non-singular\n",
    " - $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point Addition\n",
    "Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on $E$ and let $R$ be the point at infinity. The point addition operation is defined as:\n",
    "$$P + Q = R$$\n",
    "where $R$ is the point on $E$ that intersects the line between $P$ and $Q$.\n",
    "#### Point Doubling\n",
    "Let $P$ be a point on $E$ and let $R$ be the point at infinity. The point doubling operation is defined as:\n",
    "$$P + P = R$$\n",
    "where $R$ is the point on $E$ that intersects the tangent line of $P$.\n",
